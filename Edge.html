      When I/ when people in general take photos, emotion is always taken into account, whether it be what I myself am feeling, or what I want people to feel. When i took this photo, I was feeling very emotional, so I wanted to show how emotional/ stressed I was. I took this "self- portrait" of myself sitting on the edge of a parking garage, in a relaxed/ care-free state, and I made it seem like I was about to fall over, to create a sort of tension in the photo. I also wanted to kind of confuse the viewer by making them feel uncomfortable, but by also choosing warm and playful colors and lighting. The coor scheme and lighting make it seem like I'm not at all stressed and that i'm actually just relaxing. I think there's a difference in wanting to confuse the viewer with a purpose, and confusing the viewer by chance, and I think its important to always have a purpose, whether it's in making art, a career, food, or anything in general.
