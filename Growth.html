      This was a ceramic piece that I made, and I wanted to show a progression of growth in a somewhat abstract way. When bonsai's are being grown, they are controlled throughout most of the process. I wanted to keep that control, but also show the growth in a different way. The growth I'm showing is more of a construction, rather than a natural growth, and that shows the controlling process of growing a bonsai tree, but it is also somewhat natural, in the sense that the material that is being used is natural. I wanted to play with growing and control, because I felt like the whole time I was growing, I was somewhat being pushed to make decisions that were not my own.
