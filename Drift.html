      At this point in the semester I was coming down from all the stress, but the exhaustion was hitting hard, along with some other personal problems, so again I wanted to play with what I was feeling/ what I wanted to feel, and that was relaxed. On youtube, there is a 24/7 live playlist of relaxing hip hop beats, so I recorded parts of 2 songs, and messed with them in audacity. I stretched out the song, and it made relaxing elongated notes, but it was way too long, so I sped up the soundtrack to the point of it sounding like an actual song. The song expresses a sense of drifting into an open space. I think that when you want your audience to feel a certain way, you should at the very least, feel the same feeling that you want to express.
