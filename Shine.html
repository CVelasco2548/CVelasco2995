      I wanted to keep experimenting with lights, so I did cause fuck it. In this Photo, I wasn't trying to hide any light, instead I made it shine through. I did this to give the viewer a sense of awe. I want the viewer to just appreciate what they have in front of them. The photo is so bright, that the viewer's eye is imediately caught by it. I wanted this do this because in this time, people are always moving in a fast pace, and they never really try to appreciate what they have in front of them. I'm not saying that they have to appreciate this photo in particular, but i think that this photo would be able to catch people's attention quickly.
