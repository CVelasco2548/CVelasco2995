       The idea for this digital image is that it's a parody of something that is somewhat serious.There's been a lot of bad news going on arounf the world, so I wanted to play with a different world, and Mars fit that category perfectly. When you think of aliens, you think of something like E.T. or those big headed aliens, but technically we are the aliens to Mars, so this image isn't entirely wrong. You can also see that the alien is from America, and as Americans, it's really weird to be called the alien. Photoshop was my main tool for creating this digital image, consisting of 3 found images, and the use of photoshop.
