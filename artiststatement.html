     <p> It Me :)<br><br>
      IT ME AGAIN :)<br><br>
      

      <p> I think that my practice so far is trying to show people what I am or was feeling at the time that the art was made. I think that this is important, because I want to be able to connect with people, or have them connect to me, and can do that through expressing what I am or was feeling. In general for most of the projects I would either use my camera, or found subjects, and edit them in photoshop, lightroom, premeire, etc. I documented what i was feeling at the time, and built off of that, I would start with that feeling, and play with things that can represent that one feeling, and branch off into what that feeling could lead to, or what it has done. I think that my edge photograph is a great example for this, because I was feeling emotional at the time, and I wanted to express that in the photo, but I also wanted to confuse the viewer by making it seem like everything was actually perfectly fine, and I was just relaxing. I also think that Growth is a good example, because playing with the two feelings of, growth and control work together great.<br><br>

      I wanted to emphasize the importance of trying to connect with people through feelings and emotions, because I think people are unaware of how similar we really are. I think that my concepts relate to my work because, I'm always trying to get some sort of reaction, feeling, or emotion out of the viewer. This practice started when I was taking a hance building ceramic class in my community college, My professor at the time asked me what I want my viewer to do, and I said I want any kind of reaction from them, but I also want them to work for it (in a sense that they have to actually analyze the art), and it all started there. I always want my viewer to have a reaction of some sort, I want them to analyze the piece for them to understand, and when they get to understand what the piece is about, they can understand how I am or was feeling.
