      In this movie, Whiplash, they already emphasized the importance of each scene by focusing onto the actor, or the object, but I wanted to take it a step farther, and focus on the most important parts of the scene. I wanted to play with what I was feeling at the time, and at this point in the semster (midterms) it's important to focus on schoolwork and/ or work in general. I was also playing with stress, in the sense that I was stressing the the point of focus, and I was EXTREMELY stressed at the time.
