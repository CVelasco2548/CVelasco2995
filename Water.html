      <h1>Waters that?</h1>

            <p>Waters That?
        <br><br>
       <p>Photography, Photoshop
        <br><br>
       <p>720x580
      <br><br>

      With this project, I started by taking 12 photos of someone's water, and messed around with that. I created a smart oobject with all 12 photos, and duplicated the layers, I then put the first layer in a Median Stack, and the other layer in a mean stack, then I duplicated both of those stacks, and created a new smart object, and stacked it into a standard deviation. We had a guest speaker (I forgot his name lol whoops), and he taught us some new techniques on photoshop, so I wanted to try out the stacking technique. I think it's a pretty interesting conecpt to glitch a piece of art, it's almost like, if not actually, abstracting a piece of art. i'm not used to this at all, nor do i like to abstract my pieces that much, so this was really new for me.
